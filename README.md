# Password Manager created with pyQT5
simple password manager created with pyqt5

## How it works

## How to use it?

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Install PyQT5
   - open terminal and write `pip install pyqt5`

when you download all, you can also work with this

## How it works

After you have downloaded everything you need, then you can launch the application

You will see a small window where you need to enter your password, which you specify in the code.


![video-manager](video/videomanager.mp4)


If you have entered the correct password, you will see a window with your passwords, which you can change also in the code
![right-pass](img/managerphoto.png)


If your password is wrong you will have this window
![error-photo](img/managerphotoerror.png)


Maybe in the future I will improve this project to make it work better!
